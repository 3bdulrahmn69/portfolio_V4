          I&apos;m Abdulrahman Moussa, a frontend developer who loves creating
          responsive and user-friendly web interfaces. I started my journey
          through self-learning, building small projects and diving into HTML,
          CSS, and JavaScript on my own. That foundation led me to join the ALX
          Software Engineering program, where I improved my problem-solving
          skills and learned how to build real-world applications through
          consistent, independent learning. After that, I joined the Intensive
          Training Program (ITP) at the Information Technology Institute (ITI),
          specializing in frontend and cross-platform development. There, I
          worked on practical projects using modern tools like React and APIs.
          Learning has always been at the heart of what I do â€” before ALX and
          ITI, during them, and still every day. I&apos;m always exploring
          better ways to build fast, accessible, and modern web experiences.
